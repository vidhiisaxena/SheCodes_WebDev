# SheCodes_WebDev
I got the wonderful oppotunity to learn Web Development from SheCodes through the SheCodes Scholarship. Learning these skills from Matt Delac has been an amazing experience. I have succesfully completed the SheCodes Basics Course and learnt using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for Web Development. This Repository includes my projects made during SheCodes Sessions.
